\subsubsection*{Discussions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rundown of sum-product
\item Junction tree
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Topics for Review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence and graphs
\item Elimination - sum over all factors a variables appears in
\item Reconstituted graph
\item Moralization - resulting graph might have fewer independence assumptions
\item Complexity of elimination is exponential in the size of the elimination clique
\item Tree-structured elimination - sum-product/message passing
\item Junction tree
\end{itemize}
